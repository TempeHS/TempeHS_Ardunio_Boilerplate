  Learning Intention: The students will learn what 'pulse width modulation' is and how to use it to write analogue data on a digital PIN.
  Success Criteria:
    1. I understand what pulse width modulation is
    2. I can identify the PWM PINS on the Arduino Uno
    3. I can wire an RGB LED for PWM control in TINKERCAD
    5. I can write PWM data to multiple pins and manually change the colour of the LED
