  Learning Intention: The students will learn about the different data types used in the C++ language and how they can be converted for storage or computation
  Success Criteria:
    1. I understand and can store variables in the datatypes string, interger, float, longs and boolean
    2. I know how to access more information about the different datatypes in the documentation
    3. I Understand how (1, HIGH and true) and (0, LOW, false) all represent the same concept and can be used interchangeably in an INO sketch
    4. I can convert an integer, float and boolean to a string and print it in to the serial monitor
    5. I understand the difference between an int and an unsigned int or a long or an unsigned long
    6. I understand the difference between a global variable and a function variable
