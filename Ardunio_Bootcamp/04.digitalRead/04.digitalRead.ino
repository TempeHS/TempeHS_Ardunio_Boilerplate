  Learning Intention: The students will learn how to wire a pull-up and pull-down switch and configure PINs for digital input and read binary data from those PINs.
  Success Criteria:
    1. I understand how to configure a PIN for input
    2. I can wire a switch for digital input in TINKERCAD
    3. I know how to read binary data from a specific PIN
    4. I understand that LOW = false = 0 = <1.5 volts (or Off) and that HIGH = true = 1 = >3 volts (or On)
    5. I know the difference between a switch and a momentary switch
    6. I can organise output data so it correctly plots on the serial monitor
    7. I can apply this knowledge to the Button and the Line Finder in the sensor kit
