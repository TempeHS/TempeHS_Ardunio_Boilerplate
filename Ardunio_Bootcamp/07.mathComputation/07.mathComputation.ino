  Learning Intention: The students will learn basic math and arithmetic operations
    1. I know the arithmetic operation symbols %, *, +, -, / & =
    2. I can perform arithmetic calculations
    3. I know how to access more information in the documentation about math and arithmetic
    4. I can access the order of operations documentation and use parenthesis to control the order of operations
    5. I understand short-hand incrementation and decrementation 
    6. I can seed and generate a random number
    7. I can map an analogue value on a range of 0-1023 to a PWM value on a range of 0-255

  Student Notes:
    % (remainder)
    * (multiplication)
    + (addition)
    - (subtraction)
    / (division)
    = (assignment operator)
