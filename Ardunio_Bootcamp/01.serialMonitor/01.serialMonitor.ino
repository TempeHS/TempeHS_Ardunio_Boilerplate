  Learning Intention: The students will understand the difference between the inbuilt setup and loop methods, and understand the basics of the serial monitor'.
  Success Criteria:
    1. I understand the different behaviours of the setup and loop methods
    2. I can print information to the serial monitor
    3. I can print information to a new line of the serial monitor
    4. I can access the serial plotter to see data output over time
    5. I understand the impact of having more than one setup or loop methods in my sketch
